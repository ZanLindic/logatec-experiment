# logatec-experiment

Continuous delivery template - deployment of experiments in the LOG-a-TEC testbed.

More info about the testbed can be found [here](http://log-a-tec.eu/ap-cradio.html#jsi-campus "Official web-site").

## LoRa Branch

We don't need Contiki-NG OS here - Vesna devices use ALH protocol, so we need only vesna-drivers sub-module.

**NOTE**

Make sure that your submodule is on the right branch:

| submodule | branch |
| :-------: | :----: |
| vesna-drivers | logatec-testbed |

## Experiments

To make an experiment follow the instructions in *README.md* in folder applications.
