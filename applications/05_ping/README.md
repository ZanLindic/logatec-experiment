# Ping app

Application for measuring network statistics - with implemented ping command. \
Every elapsed *PING_SEND_TIME* seconds, (only root!) device will ping its neighbor and wait for its response.

Ping option was made with the help of Contiki-NG example in Contiki Shell.

**Build on top of the *03_stats-app* application. Detailed information on application working can be found there.**
